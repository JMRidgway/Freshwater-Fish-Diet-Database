Dates that only had month and year were assigned a day as "1" to allow the dates to have a common format. 
Dates that had only year (e.g. sampled between 1955 and 1957) were assigned 1/1/1955 and 1/1/1957, unless seasons were given , in which case month corresponded with the start and end of each season relative to the hemisphere of the site.

All below were done to database/data_fish.rds
Finalized all prey_taxon taxonomic information - most used classification in taxize package, but some were searched and entered by hand in excel, then imported to data_fish.rds
Added a column called "prey_type" that identifies animal, plant, detritus, sand, etc.
Deleted some rows with missing values or duplicates that were identified during taxizing
Added a "measure_numeric" column that contains the measurements as numbers
Assigned trace values to 0.0001 in "measure_numeric" b/c the lowest non-zero value in the dataset was 0.0002, so this is half of that.
Fixed data entry error with Ayinla (forgot to delete column before gathering, so prey taxon included % and No., etc).
Added pipe to 2_script_update_master.R that will create a measure_numeric column and fix typos based on previous occurrences.
