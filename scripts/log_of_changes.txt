Dates that only had month and year were assigned a day as "1" to allow the dates to have a common format. 
Dates that had only year (e.g. sampled between 1955 and 1957) were assigned 1/1/1955 and 1/1/1957, unless seasons were given , in which case month corresponded with the start and end of each season relative to the hemisphere of the site.

All below were done to database/data_fish.rds
Finalized all prey_taxon taxonomic information - most used classification in taxize package, but some were searched and entered by hand in excel, then imported to data_fish.rds
Added a column called "prey_type" that identifies animal, plant, detritus, sand, etc.
Deleted some rows with missing values or duplicates that were identified during taxizing
Added a "measure_numeric" column that contains the measurements as numbers
Assigned trace values to 0.0001 in "measure_numeric" b/c the lowest non-zero value in the dataset was 0.0002, so this is half of that.
Fixed data entry error with Ayinla (forgot to delete column before gathering, so prey taxon included % and No., etc).
Added pipe to 2_script_update_master.R that will create a measure_numeric column and fix typos based on previous occurrences.

2020-02-06
updated dates to common format
updated missing fish species. Column "fish_species" currently has zero NA's
updated length measures to common format (total length, standard length, fork length, wet weight, na, NA)

2020-02-07
Removed frequency of occurrence data from two papers (White and Wallace 1973 and Modde and Schmulbach 1977)
cleaned the measurement_unit and measurement_type columns. Now cleaned into a single column measurement_typeunits
Added fish_id this way... %>% unite(fish_id_add, c(site_name, predator_min_length, predator_max_length, type_of_fish,
                       sample_size, measurement_type, measurement_units, author, year, citation, table_figure, 
                       start_date, end_date, fish_family, fish_genus, fish_species), remove = F, na.rm = F) %>%
  mutate(fish_id = as.numeric(as.factor(fish_id_add))) %>% 
  select(-fish_id_add)
Lots of percentage data don't add up to 100. Need to work on this on Monday.

2020-02-11
re-added some data that didn't add to 100. 


2020-02-12
fixed typos in Allin 1928. All percentages now add to 100. Error was in Chloryphyceae that was entered as 20 when it should have been 10 (checked originals).
updated errors in the following (all _updated were turned into data_fish)
data_fish_updated <- data_fish %>% 
  mutate(measurement = case_when(fish_id == 396 & prey_taxon == "Chlorophyceae" ~ "10",
                                 fish_id == 447 & prey_taxon == "Fish" ~ "50",
                                 TRUE ~ measurement),
         measure_numeric = case_when(fish_id == 396 & prey_taxon == "Chlorophyceae" ~ "10",
                                     fish_id == 447 & prey_taxon == "Fish" ~ "50",
                                     TRUE ~ measure_numeric))


data_fish_updated <- data_fish %>% filter(prey_taxon != "x" & prey_taxon != "x_1")

As of 2020-02-012 at 133pm, all percent data is <=105. I assume that most of the values that are above 100 are due to papers reporting the averages of percent in each category, rather than percent of the total prey caught.
fixed Adite and Miller 2015 to be proportions rather than percents (measurement type and measurement_typeunits were fixed)


2020-02-14
removed Yalcin 2001. Numbers in original paper are not percentages, even though table says they are. 
removed Whitaker 1977 (or 1997 typo). Need to re-extract due to table continuation that was lost.
removed Cable 1923. Need to re-extract. Lot's of problems.
removed Roman 2014. Numbers were reported for "main items only' according to table 2 legend.
removed Huish 1957. Need to re-extract. Lot's of problems in original extraction.
removed Moffet & Hunt. Numbers did not add to 100. Deleted.
removed Goodson 1965. Numbers did not add to 100, but need to check and re-extract
removed Klieman et al. 2019. Need to re-extract. Numbers were not correct. Table extrated included a sum column.

removed sample sizes of zero (Crawford and Cable papers)
re-entered and Wasserman et al. Original extraction missed a table continuation
re-entered Brown 1938. Original had error in extraction. 
re-entered Williams 1980 tables 1, 2, and 5. Original had error in extraction.
re-entered Maddern tbl4

2020-02-16
deleted Alexander and Perkins 2013. Data did not add to 100 in original
deleted one sample from Arawomo b/c original data did not add to 100

2020-02-17
Checked Cochran & Adelman tbl2. One sample adds to 98%. Left it in, b/c the data are averages. Probably a result of averaging, rather than mistaken entry.
Deleted Rice 1942 table 1. Need to re-extract. Mistakes in extraction step initially. 
Checked Galat 1983 tbl2. One sample adds to 98%. Left it in, b/c the data are averages. Probably a result of averaging, rather than mistaken entry.
Checked Mathur 1977 tbl3. Trace values are "<5%" 
Checked de Almeida 1997 tbl1. It's at 101%, likely due to averaging.

deleted three other papers and added them to the "need_to_reextract.xlxs" file.
Current data_fish_updated has only percentages that are between 98 and 101. Checks on these suggest that they are mostly due to averaging, not mistakes.

2020-02-18
Checked de Held 1974 Table 3. It's at 101%, likely due to averaging.
Checked Wilde 2001 table 2. It's at 101%, likely due to averaging.
deleted Sanchez-Hernandez 2012. Need to re-extract. It has a two-page table, but only one page was extracted originally.
deleted Mathur 1977 Table 3
delted Adite 1997 Table 3
deleted Adite 1997 Table 4
